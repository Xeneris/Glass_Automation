# Glass Automation

# About the project
This is a quick demo project, that automates a small number of features of the Jira addon Glass.
I used the POM design pattern, because I think it makes the code easy to read, and anyone can see what the pages contain on the first glance.

# Technologies used
 In this project the following technologies were used: Java, Cucumber, Gherkin.
